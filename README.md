# HAR-data-cleaning
Human Activity Recognition Data Cleaning Course Project

R script code to generate HAR data frames for analysis is in "run_analysis.R".
Data frame variables are documented in "CODEBOOK.md".
A text file version of the summary data frame HARsummary is provided as "HARsummary.txt".

## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project, January 2016
## data set information at
## http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#
## 30 volunteers
## age 19-48 years
## six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
## embedded accelerometer and gyroscope
## 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz
## data has been labelled manually
## dataset has been randomly divided
##     70% of volunteers -> training data
##     30% of volunteers -> test data
## Attribute Information, for each record in the dataset it is provided: 
## - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
## - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
## - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. (X_test, X_train)
## - Its activity label. (y_test, y_train)
## - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. (subject_test, subject_train)
